### **Create Hackathon**

   Once your application is approved, you’ll gain access to the **Hackathon Organizer** in the navigation bar. From there, you can begin setting up your first hackathon on HackQuest by clicking **“Start a New Hackathon”**.

   The first step in creating your hackathon is to enter its name. As soon as you input the name, your hackathon will be created on HackQuest.

3. **Complete the 7 Required Sections**

   After naming your hackathon, you’ll need to fill out **7 required sections** to fully set up your event:

   - **Info**: This section allows you to input basic details about your hackathon, including the event’s name, your organization’s name, and a brief online introduction. This will give participants an idea of what your hackathon is about.

   - **Links**: Here, you will provide important links such as your hackathon’s official website and social media profiles, making it easier for participants to follow updates and engage with the event.

   - **Covers**: You’ll need to upload a cover image that represents your hackathon. This visual will appear on the hackathon page to give it a distinct look and feel.

   - **Timeline**: Set the timeline for your hackathon. At a minimum, define the registration, submission, and judging start and close times.

   - **Application**: In this section, you’ll define the registration requirements for applicants, including the criteria for submitting projects.

   - **Reward**: Set up rewards for the hackathon. You must define at least one prize track and specify the judging criteria for your prizes.

### **Manage Hackathon**

The **Manage Hackathon** section of HackQuest provides a centralized platform for organizers to oversee and manage all aspects of their hackathon. This comprehensive dashboard enables organizers to handle participant applications, project submissions, judging, and announcements efficiently. By utilizing these features, you can ensure that your hackathon runs smoothly and successfully. Below is a breakdown of the key sections within the organizer dashboard:

1. **Overview**

This section presents a high-level snapshot of your hackathon’s progress. You’ll be able to monitor essential statistics, such as page views, the number of applications submitted, confirmed participants, and project submissions. It offers a quick and easy way to track the overall progress of your hackathon in real-time.

2. **Application**

Within this section, you can review all incoming applications, download application forms for further review, and decide whether to approve, decline, or add applicants to a waitlist. If your hackathon is a hybrid or in-person event, you can approve applicants in groups and even undo any declines before the application deadline. This gives you full control over the participant selection process.

3. **Submission**

Managing project submissions happens in this section, where you can review all projects submitted to your hackathon. You have the option to download submissions for closer inspection, disqualify submissions that do not meet the criteria, and undo disqualifications if necessary. Submissions are organized by project, and each project displays all associated team members, allowing for easy review.

4. **Judging**

Track the judging process in this section, where you can monitor the rankings and scores for each prize track. Additionally, you can review the individual scores from each judge and see how projects were rated. If voting is enabled, this section will also show the votes from users and judges. After the voting and scoring are complete, you can announce the winners by clicking the **“Announce Winners”** button.

5. **Announcement**

In the **Announcement** section, you manage event-related announcements. There are two types: event-based announcements, which are triggered by key milestones such as registration, submission, and judging, and user-specific announcements, which you can create and target specific groups. This ensures that participants, judges, and other stakeholders stay informed at critical points throughout the event.

6. **Distribution**

This section helps you track and analyze the traffic to your hackathon’s page. By adding UTM sources, you can monitor where your traffic is coming from—whether it’s social media, email campaigns, or other sources. The section also provides detailed statistics on page views, applications, confirmations, and submissions. A visualized distribution table makes it easier to interpret and compare the data, giving you valuable insights into your promotional efforts.

7. **Admin**

The **Admin** section lets you manage the administrators of your hackathon. You can add new admins, assign different levels of access, and decide whether each admin has read-only or full administrative permissions. This ensures that you can control who has access to various parts of the hackathon, maintaining security and organization throughout the event.
